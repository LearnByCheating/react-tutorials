# React Base App

This app was built following the steps from the "Create a React App from Scratch" tutorial. It uses the Vite development server.

To launch the app, first install the npm packages listed in the package.json file:
`npm install`

To start the app, open the Terminal to this directory and enter command:
`npm run dev`

Then open your web browser and go to: http://localhost:5173/

It should open to a page that displays "Home Page".

To stop the server from the Terminal enter `Control+C`
